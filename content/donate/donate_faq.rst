.. _How are you associated with Oregon State University?:

**How are you associated with Oregon State University?**

The Open Source Lab is part of The School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Oregon State University.
Our staff are all OSU employees, and our student employees are all OSU students. We receive many benefits from being
part of the University including office space, data center space, infrastructure, and a close tie to students who are
interested in working with open source. We receive very little direct funding from the University, which is why we rely
on external donations for our operations.

.. _Are donations tax deductible?:

**Are donations tax deductible?**

The OSU Foundation is an IRS 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation, which provides many donors a tax advantage. Please
contact the OSU Foundation directly if you have questions about your eligibility.

.. _What is the OSU Foundation?:

**What is the OSU Foundation?**

The OSU Foundation handles all donations for Oregon State University. The Foundation works with university partners
like the OSL to raise funds that support the university’s priorities. For more information, visit their `website`_.

.. _I work for a company that has a donation matching program, how can I get them to match my donation to the OSUOSL?:

**I work for a company that has a donation matching program, how can I get them to match my donation to the OSUOSL?**

Many corporations have programs which will match donations to educational institutions. The OSU Foundation can help you
find out if your company has a `matching gift policy`_.

If you don't find your employer or have further questions, please contact your employer or the OSU Foundation directly
to find out if your donation is eligible for a matching program.

    :alt: Income for the 2019 fiscal year

Our annual expenses are roughly $400,000. Our goal is to raise at least enough to cover those expenses. The exact
amount we need to cover with donations varies based on paid hosting and grant-supported funding we receive. Any
additional funding beyond what we need to operate during this fiscal year will go towards expenses beyond the current
fiscal year.

We get approximately 80% of our income from corporate and individual donation giving. The other 20% is covered through
various hosting contracts we have with larger FOSS projects. The larger FOSS projects pay at-cost to help subsidize the
expenses for the smaller projects and thus keep the vast majority of our hosting free. Below you can find a pie chart
showing the breakdown of our income for the 2019 fiscal year.

.. _What will you use my donation for?:

    :alt: Expenses for the 2019 fiscal year

Many of the services we provide for open source projects are provided for no-cost. We rely on donations to cover the
expenses we incur providing these valuable services. Below is a breakdown of our expenses for the 2019 fiscal year.

Below are a few examples of where we have spent money in the past year:

* **Staff/Student Salaries:** We spend nearly 62% of our budget on staff and student salaries. This also includes any
  benefits we pay to full-time staff.  All of the students we employ receive higher hourly wages compared to the
  average OSU student worker.

* **Travel:** When funding allows, we send our staff and students to open source conferences. This enables the OSL to
  stay on top of new technologies along with sharing experiences and ideas we have learned hosting FOSS projects.

* **Bandwidth:** Our bandwidth is not free so some of our budget is allocated to support our network and the staff that
  support it.

* **Community Events:** Another part of our budget is dedicated towards supporting community events such as `Beaver
  Barcamp`_ and `DevOps Bootcamp`_.  These events allow us to broaden our exposure to students at OSU and the
  community.

* **Infrastructure Equipment:** A part of our budget is dedicated towards infrastructure upgrades and repair. This
  includes supporting services such as our virtualization cluster, database machines, web servers and other various
  core infrastructure hardware needs.

.. _What projects do you support?:

**What projects do you support?**
The OSUOSL supports a large number of growing, high-impact open source communities. This includes the Apache Software
Foundation, the Linux Foundation, Drupal, and many others. For a full list, please see our `projects page`_.

.. _projects page: http://osuosl.org/services/hosting/communities

.. _How is the OSUOSL run?:

**How is the OSUOSL run?**

We have one full-time Director who oversees all lab activities, and we employ about seven to ten students at any
given time.

.. _What will happen if you don't meet your fund raising goal?:

**What will happen if you don't meet your fund raising goal?**

Our foremost goal is to continue to provide world-class hosting services to open source projects. Should we fail to
meet our fundraising target, we will be forced to reevaluate our priorities and eliminate some of the lab's activities.
This decision, should it need to be made, will be discussed with the OSUOSL Advisory Council, and decided upon with OSU
leadership.

.. _Who else is supporting the OSUOSL financially?:

**Who else is supporting the OSUOSL financially?**

The OSUOSL has many sponsors who generously support our efforts. The full list of OSL sponsors is available on our
`sponsors page`_.  We also receive support from many individuals, smaller companies and projects.
