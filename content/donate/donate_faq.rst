.. _How are you associated with Oregon State University?:

**How are you associated with Oregon State University?**

The Open Source Lab is part of The School of Electrical Engineering and Computer
Science at Oregon State University. Our staff are all OSU employees, and our
student employees are all OSU students. We receive many benefits from being part
of the University including office space, data center space, infrastructure, and
a close tie to students who are interested in working with open source. We
receive very little direct funding from the University, which is why we rely on
external donations for our operations.


.. _Are donations tax deductible?:

**Are donations tax deductible?**

The OSU Foundation is an IRS 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation, which provides
many donors a tax advantage. Please contact the OSU Foundation directly if you
have questions about your eligibility.


.. _What is the OSU Foundation?:

**What is the OSU Foundation?**

The OSU Foundation handles all donations for Oregon State University. The
Foundation works with university partners like the OSL to raise funds that
support the university’s priorities. For more information, visit their
`website`_.

.. _I work for a company that has a donation matching program, how can I get
   them to match my donation to the OSUOSL?:

**I work for a company that has a donation matching program, how can I get them
to match my donation to the OSUOSL?**

Many corporations have programs which will match donations to educational
institutions. The OSU Foundation can help you find out if your company has a
`matching gift policy`_.

If you don't find your employer or have further questions, please contact your
employer or the OSU Foundation directly to find out if your donation is eligible
for a matching program.

.. _How much money are you trying to raise?:

**How much money are you trying to raise?**

Our annual expenses are roughly $1 million. Our goal is to raise at least enough
to cover those expenses. The exact amount we need to cover with donations varies
based on paid hosting and grant-supported funding we receive. Any additional
funding beyond what we need to operate during this fiscal year will go towards
expenses beyond the current fiscal year.

We get approximately 70% of our income from corporate and individual donation
giving. The other 30% is covered through various hosting contracts we have with
larger FOSS projects. The larger FOSS projects pay at-cost to help subsidize the
expenses for the smaller projects and thus keep the vast majority of our hosting
free. Below you can find a pie chart showing the breakdown of our income for the
2016 fiscal year.

.. _What will you use my donation for?:

**What will you use my donation for?**

Many of the services we provide for open source projects are provided for no-
cost. We rely on donations to cover the expenses we incur providing these
valuable services. Below is a breakdown of our expenses for the 2016 fiscal
year.

    :alt: Expenses for the 2016 fiscal year

Below are a few examples of where we have spent money in the past year:

* **Staff/Student Salaries:** We spend nearly 65% of our budget on staff and
  student salaries. This also includes any benefits we pay to full-time staff.
  All of the students we employ receive higher hourly wages compared to the
  average OSU student worker.

* **Travel:** When funding allows, we send our staff and students to open source
  conferences. This enables the OSL to stay on top of new technologies along
  with sharing experiences and ideas we have learned hosting FOSS projects.

* **Bandwidth:** Our bandwidth is not free so some of our budget is allocated to
  support our network and the staff that support it.

* **Community Events:** Another part of our budget is dedicated towards
  supporting community events such as `Beaver Barcamp`_ and `DevOps Bootcamp`_.
  These events allow us to broaden our exposure to students at OSU and the
  community.

* **Infrastructure Equipment:** A part of our budget is dedicated towards
  infrastructure upgrades and repair. This includes supporting services such as
  our virtualization cluster, database machines, web servers and other various
  core infrastructure hardware needs.

.. _What projects do you support?:

**What projects do you support?**
The OSUOSL supports a large number of growing, high-impact open source
communities. This includes the Apache Software Foundation, the Linux Foundation,
Drupal, and many others. For a full list, please see our `projects page`_.

.. _projects page: http://osuosl.org/services/hosting/communities


.. _How is the OSUOSL run?:

**How is the OSUOSL run?**

We have one full-time Director who oversees all activities of the lab and we employ about seven to ten students at any
given time.

The OSUOSL Advisory Council, a group of experts from open source projects and
industry, for suggestions and advice on opportunities and direction for the lab.
Learn more about our `Advisory Council members`_.

.. _Advisory Council members: http://osuosl.org/advisors


.. _What will happen if you don't meet your fund raising goal?:

**What will happen if you don't meet your fund raising goal?**

Our foremost goal is to continue to provide world-class hosting services to open
source projects. Should we fail to meet our fundraising target, we will be
forced to reevaluate our priorities and eliminate some of the lab's activities.
This decision, should it need to be made, will be discussed with the OSUOSL
Advisory Council, and decided upon with OSU leadership.


.. _Who else is supporting the OSUOSL financially?:

**Who else is supporting the OSUOSL financially?**

The OSUOSL has many sponsors who generously support our efforts. The full list
of OSL sponsors is available on our `sponsors page`_.  We also receive support
from many individuals, smaller companies and projects.
