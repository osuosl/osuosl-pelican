Google Summer of Code is a yearly program hosted by Google designed to pair
accepted student applicants with trained mentors in an effort to generate as
many programming projects as possible. The goal of this initiative is to connect
Open Source programs around the globe to create an international community
through code. The OSU Open Source Lab has served as a GSoC mentor for several
years. We use this project as a way to introduce our own students to this
international community while improving our existing systems through
collaborative and original programming strategies.

Though you must be accepted into the program, any student 18 and older may
apply. For more information on the program and on how to apply, visit Google's
`GSoC website`_. For more information on the OSL's involvement, please visit our
`GSOC information page`_.

Make this summer your Summer of Code!
