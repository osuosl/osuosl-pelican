activities that the OSL provides for more than 160 high-profile open source
projects since joining the lab as lead systems administrator and architect in
2007. Lance’s involvement in the open source community began in 2003, when he
became a developer and package maintainer with `Gentoo Linux`_. Prior to
joining the OSL, Lance was a UNIX Administrator for the Enterprise Server
Technologies group at `Kansas State University`_. In his free time he helps
organize `Beaver BarCamp`_ and plays trumpet in local jazz group `The
Infallible Collective`_.

  **Student Systems Engineer**

JJ joined CASS in March 2017 and is studying computer science. Even before
joining the OSL, JJ used open source programs such as Linux on his own personal
computers. Having a lot of experience and interest in the field already, the
Open Source Lab was a perfect fit for him. He is also interested in video game
design and application building as well as refurbishing old computers. He’s been
programming since he was six years old and in his spare time he likes to play
dodgeball.

  **Student Systems Engineer**

Hunter joined the OSL in March 2018 and is studying applied computer science
with an emphasis on video game and simulation programming. He overheard a
classmate talking about applying for CASS, and did some research on the OSL,
which he found to be interesting. He hopes to learn more about the inner
workings of GNU/Linux operating systems and security. He enjoys both CLI and
graphical programming, hiking, biking, and the occasional unicycle ride through
campus. He also has three pet rats: Calvin, Earl the Squirrel, and Klaus the Mouse.

  **Student Systems Engineer**

Jason joined the OSL in April 2018 and is studying computer science and
mathematics. He joined the lab to work with open source projects and gain a
better understanding of how software is deployed at a large scale. During his
free time, he likes to watch various sports, including basketball,
football, and soccer, listen to Air Traffic Control, and program. He hopes to
work in a software engineering-related field after graduation, but if that does
not work out, he might go fly planes instead.

.. class:: no-breaks

  **Student Systems Engineer**

Khuong joined the OSL in February 2019 and is studying Computer Science with the Computer System option. He first
learned about the OSL from teammates at the `OSU Security Team`_ who were working there. Khuong strongly believes in the
high impact and importance of open-source software and loves building things that empower other people. OSL's missions
align perfectly with his career goals. When not in front of computers, Khuong spends a lot of time training to compete
for the `OSU Table Tennis team`_ and sometimes plays soccer or badminton for fun. Video games, `manga`_, movies, learning,
and browsing on `r/aww`_ are other things he especially enjoys. After graduation, Khuong plans to adopt a lot of dogs and
cats.

Kerry joined the OSL in February 2019 and is studying computer science. He
learned about OSL through the `OSU Linux Users Group`_ and applied as soon as
they had an opening. He joined the lab to contribute to the open source
community and learn more about how Linux is used in an operational context. He
enjoys talking people into ditching Mac and Windows for Linux, philosophical
discussions about the nature of existence, throwing together Raspberry pi and
other projects that never get finished, and hiking. He also can't play guitar.
