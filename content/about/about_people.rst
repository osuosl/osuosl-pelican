Jason joined the OSL in April 2018 and is studying computer science and
mathematics. He joined the lab to work with open source projects and gain a
better understanding of how software is deployed at a large scale. During his
free time, he likes to watch various sports, including basketball,
football, and soccer, listen to Air Traffic Control, and program. He hopes to
work in a software engineering-related field after graduation, but if that does
not work out, he might go fly planes instead.
