Paul joined the OSL in May 2021. He's been using OSL mirrors since arriving on campus, and is glad for the opportunity
to contribute to the FOSS ecosystem. He's been using Linux since high school, and enjoys optimizing his work
environment and trying out new community projects.  Paul is a computer science major and is interested in
cybersecurity, infrastructure automation, and spending 3 hours writing scripts that save 1 minute. He spends the time
that these scripts save hunting mushrooms, reading, and rock climbing.

.. class:: no-breaks

  **Student Systems Engineer**

Starting in November of 2022, Zach was brought aboard during his Junior year of his college career as a Computer
Science major. Zach's first introduction to programming dated back to the fifth grade, in 2013, where he did a
presentation on "How to Create an Adder in Lua". His first experience with the Linux environment started in late-2019,
when he used a Raspberry-Pi to set up a local file sharing server; and ever since then he's used some flavor of Linux
as a daily driver for both personal and server use. Outside of the office and classroom, Zach enjoys modding games,
with an added interest in level design. With now being employed at the Open Source Lab, he hopes to further understand
the duties of a systems administrator while also providing assistance in service hosting for the FOSS community.

  **Student Systems Engineer**

Oria has been excited about open-source software from far too young an age, so no one should have told her there was an
Open Source Lab right at OSU! In all seriousness, she started at the OSL in November 2022 as a way to further explore
computer science and get involved in the open-source community. When not learning new ways to play on computers, she
dabbles in digital drawing, board games, and animation.
