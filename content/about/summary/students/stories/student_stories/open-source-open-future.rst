Students reap the benefits of professional programming experience at the OSU
Open Source Lab

As a freshman at `Oregon State University`_ in early 2010, Jordan Evans didn't
have a lot of computer science experience. Though he had always had an interest
in computers, Evans had come to OSU as a mathematics major and, like many
first-year students, didn't yet have a clear idea of what he hoped to do with
his education.

  *“I decided I liked math classes better than I liked computer science classes,
  so I kept taking math classes,” Evans says. “I really had no idea what I would
  do with it. I knew what I liked but I didn’t know how to apply that to
  anything.”*

Two years later, Evans' career goals have undergone a radical change. Since June
2010, Evans has worked at OSU's Open Source Lab, where he’s built up an
impressive resume that includes two years of professional experience as a system
administrator, a summer internship with Google and knowledge of exactly what he
wants to do in the future.

  *“I think the OSL kind of shaped my interests,” Evans says. “Working here
  gives us a practical application for everything that we’re doing in classes.”*

Evans is one of 12 students working at the lab, which provides hosting and
support services to some of the most well-known open source projects in the
world. Students work alongside professional staff members to maintain servers,
write program code and provide technical support for the software the OSL hosts.

While the lab fulfills a valuable role at OSU by hosting various projects and
helping the university reduce costs through open source software alternatives,
its services make an even bigger impact on a worldwide scale, enabling more than
600,000 downloads daily and contributing to software like the `Drupal content
management system`_, `Apache Web server`_ and `Linux operating system`_ that
individuals, start-up businesses and organizations around the globe use every
day.

**Code for success**

But the OSL's greatest impact may be the ubiquitous effect it has on the
students who spend years of their college careers learning and working in the
lab. Nearly all of the students who have worked at the lab since its inception
in 2003 have gone on to find immediate success in the technical world after
graduation, founding start-up companies, receiving job offers from top software
companies and enjoying the opportunity to define their own professional paths.

With graduates at companies like `Google`_ and `Mozilla`_, as well as at the
helm of several successful start-up companies, the OSL has a habit of producing
students who are prepared to skyrocket through the industry. The advantage, says
`Alex Polvi`_, an OSU alumnus who worked at the OSL throughout his college
years, is the foundation of practical experience students are allowed to build
in the lab.

  *“The critical part is real-world experience, solving problems for actual
  customers with skills that are needed in the real world,” Polvi says. “You’re
  going to graduate with a job from here and have a real career path.”*

Polvi experienced firsthand the powerful impact a few years at the OSL can have
on a developing career. While working at the OSL, he completed internships with
Google and Mozilla. During his senior year he worked for Mozilla remotely from
OSU, and the company offered him a job immediately after graduation. Polvi and
two other OSU alums went on to form `Cloudkick`_, a startup that drew several
million dollars from investors before being purchased by a larger company.

  *“I do not hesitate at all saying that my success is 100 percent because of
  the OSL,” Polvi says. “They set me up to have a successful career. Without
  that, I don’t know what I’d be doing.”*

**A blend of mentorship and independence**

As a system administrator, Evans largely determines his own projects and has the
experience and the knowledge to solve most of his own problems. While students
receive a great amount of training from professional staff during their first
several months at the lab, Evans says students who have been at the lab longer
become mentors themselves, helping new students familiarize themselves with the
work.

  *“We’re still learning a lot, but we’re also able to teach others,” Evans
  says. “That really solidifies what we’ve learned. If we’re able to teach it to
  someone new and pass on that same knowledge, then we’ve definitely come to a
  point where we understand the skills and the technical knowledge required.”*

That shift in responsibilities is part of the process OSL Associate Director of
Operations `Lance Albertson`_ hopes to provide students with throughout their
time in the lab. Albertson gives students increasing levels of independence as
they progress and lets them tackle problems on their own, offering support when
they need it but first allowing them the opportunity to succeed without his
help.

  *“I make sure they have ownership of something,” Albertson says. “I try not to
  manage what they do as much as I can. If I give them a big project they
  usually take it on and they will immerse themselves.”*

According to Evans, the benefit of working independently as well as being
responsible for collaborating with other students and the individuals who rely
on OSL services goes beyond developing the competence to succeed in a
professional environment.

  *“I think it’s shaped me to do really well because it's taught me not only how
  to work in the field, but how to work with other people in the field,” Evans
  says. “In our job we have to reach out and communicate about projects, and
  it’s taught me to keep an open mind and to not be afraid to seek out a mentor
  in skills that I don’t have.”*

**Graduating with an edge**

The OSL has continued to expand and play a significant role in the open source
community in recent years, and currently provides at least `160 projects`_ with
various support services. Its contributions to the largest open source projects
in the world include not only technical support but graduates who leave school
uniquely prepared to benefit their future employers. According to Polvi, such
students are an important resource in a rapidly growing industry.

  *“The Open Source Lab is churning out students who are probably the most
  highly skilled people seen coming out of these education systems,” Polvi says.
  “We need more technical people and more students who can go out and get jobs,
  and this is such a great model for that.”*

Recognizing the value of the lab, leaders in the industry have responded with
support that has made it possible for the lab to take on more projects. Further
industry partnerships, Albertson says, are essential to allow the lab to offer
professional experiences to even more students.

  *“We basically give them a full work experience from the beginning, covering
  all the facets,” Albertson says. “Not only do they build technical skills,
  they build personal skills, they build professional skills and they have
  something tangible when they leave OSU other than a diploma.”*

Evans says he didn't understand how much of an impact working at the OSL would
have on his future until he started applying for internships and realized how
many opportunities were open to him because of his position at the lab. Now,
he’s grateful for the advantage of working as a system administrator while
earning his degree, and looks forward to that experience bringing him more
opportunities in the future.

  *“This really distinguishes us from other college students," Evans says. "They
  might have taken all the same classes we did, but we can put on our resume
  ‘I’ve already been doing this job for the past three years.’ That kind of
  trumps most things you can have on your resume at this point.”*
