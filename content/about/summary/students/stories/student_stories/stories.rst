Sometimes finding the best solution means starting over. That was Mike Cooper's
dilemma as he tackled his first solo project at the Oregon State University Open
Source Lab. An OSU sophomore studying computer science who had just been hired
in March 2010 to work as a system administrator for the lab, he was tasked with
securing a network connection that could be extended to laptops, allowing lab
staff and hosted projects to connect to the lab's private network from anywhere.

As a freshman at Oregon State University in early 2010, Jordan Evans didn't have

When Drupal began to outgrow its infrastructure in the summer of 2005, its
developers appealed to the open source community for help. OSL offered to host
the equipment, and students Eric Searcy and Narayan Newton were put on the case.

"We attacked the problem from two different angles," says Newton, who now works
with Tag1 Consulting and is a member of the association that runs Drupal.
Searcy, now a systems administrator at InsightsNow in Corvallis, dealt with the
scaling of the Web side of Drupal while Newton worked with the database.
