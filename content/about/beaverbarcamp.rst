Beaver BarCamp is an annual unconference hosted by the Open Source Lab as an all
day event that allows you to “share your passion.” All participants work
together to create an interactive schedule geared towards topics of the group’s
choosing. Even though the majority of the event is technologically oriented, it
is not an exclusive theme. Beaver BarCamp prides itself in its diversity and
flexibility and participants are encouraged to discuss any topic that most
interests them and while we encourage everyone to partake in the activities,
presenting a topic is purely optional.

Beaver BarCamp is open to the public and free of charge. Check out our
`website`_ for more information.

We hope to see you at the next Beaver BarCamp!
