CALLING ALL CASS STUDENTS!!!

We will be hosting a CASS Family and Friends Reception on February 25th, 2016
and you’re invited!

In attendance will be your peers, CASS alumni, and industry representatives.
This function will be very important to getting your own name out to potential
future employers, so we will be handing out thumb drives to these
representatives containing a compilation of your résumés. If you’d like your
résumé included (STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to all you looking to enter the workforce
sooner rather than later), please send it in pdf form to Amanda Kelner at
kelnera@osuosl.org by Friday, February 19th. 

This is exclusively for our hardworking students here at CASS so this
opportunity is doubly special as you won’t be competing against a horde of
other students. Don’t let this one slide by!

The reception will be from 5-7 p.m. in the fourth floor lounge of the Kelley
Engineering Center. We can’t wait to see you there!
