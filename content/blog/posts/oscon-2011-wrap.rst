Summer Camp for Geeks
---------------------

**Students at the Oregon State University Open Source Lab** (`OSL`_) **get into
a project development groove, especially during the summer months. They’re happy
to exit the groove, though, when major open source events roll into the
region.**

A group of them took a break from their daily routines and traveled to the
Oregon Convention Center in Portland last week for `OSCON`_, now in its 13th
year. Amidst dozens of booths, each with its own ornamentation -- simple and
extravagant -- they wandered, hunting for stickers, branded flashlights and
other free promotional garb, when they weren’t tending to the OSL’s own booth.

Thousands of attendees flocked to the many sessions and tutorials. The OSUOSL’s
Lead Systems Administrator and Infrastructure Architect `Lance Albertson`_
alongside Lead Software Engineer `Peter Krenesky`_ led one of each. The first
was a tutorial, `Hands on Virtualization with Ganeti`_, and Wednesday’s session
was `Ganeti Web Manager: Cluster Management Made Simple`_.

Meanwhile, the students jumped from booth to booth with the masses to learn
about new projects, startups and open source initiatives within large companies
like Facebook, Google and Intel. The Lab’s OSCON newcomers like freshmen Emily
Dunham and Alan Sherman were surprised by the varied relationships between
attendees and the open source community.

“I found it a bit interesting to get an idea of what the end users are like,”
Dunham said. “It was a much more corporate image than what I previously
associated with open source, but it’s a good reminder that it really is for
everyone.”

         cables into their respective switch in as short a time as possible.

Both Dunham and OSUOSL Outreach Manager `Leslie Hawthorn`_ attended a special
part of the Google-sponsored lunch on Wednesday. It recognized women in the open
source community.

“I got to meet some really cool people there,” Dunham said. “It’s always kind of
nice to know that being in a minority doesn’t mean you’re the only one.”

For Corbin Simpson, one of the OSL’s veteran students and OSCON returner, the
best part of the convention was the individual “birds of feather” sessions, held
after hours.

“They provide good opportunity for community members to actually discuss things
without the format of the expo hall or the tutorials,” he said. “It’s really
cool that they provided that space and that time for that.”

When they weren’t migrating to different spots, the students helped operate the
OSL booth, complete with `Ganeti Web Manager`_ for users to demo.

Candid as students often are, they admitted their Lab pitch to passersby became
rather familiar. They appreciated the repetition, which in turn improved their
knowledge of the Lab itself.

“Figuring out what aspects of the OSL people are interested, and seeing just how
many people had heard of it before gives me a lot better perspective of our
place in the community,” Dunham said. “There are aspects of it that are kind of
surprising. It’s surprising how many people haven’t heard of us, but then again
it was really nice to see how many of the booths had a little OSL sign on their
table saying, ‘We’re hosted here.’”

The OSL’s impact on the community -- the global OSCON community -- was obvious.
Students and professionals working together, in addition to supplying
world-class services for projects of varying popularity levels and directions,
the Lab held its own amongst large-scale corporations.

“I think what the OSL does is remarkably important and is possibly the most
important thing done at OSCON,” Simpson said.
