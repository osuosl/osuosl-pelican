More than 160 students, community members and educators gathered in the Kelley
Engineering Center at Oregon State to share ideas, make connections and learn
together at the Open Source Lab’s Beaver BarCamp 12 on Saturday, October 12. An
informal conference hosted twice each year by the Open Source Lab, Beaver
BarCamp encourages attendees to participate by both presenting sessions and
participating in discussions. Throughout the day, 50 sessions were presented,
with topics ranging from Python programming to starting a business to creating a
universe.

At Beaver BarCamp, sessions are scheduled the morning of the event: everyone
writes the session they are interested in presenting on a Post-It note. Interest
in sessions is gauged by having participants place dot stickers on their
favorite sessions. Next, OSL staff arrange the schedule according to the needs
of the presenters and popularity of sessions. Wendy Kincade, a master’s student
at the University of Oregon, has attended Beaver BarCamp since it began in 2008
and enjoys the freedom this aspect of BarCamp provides.

“I love the idea of showing up and talking to people about stuff that I don’t
know we’re going to talk about,” says Kincade. “The spontaneity of it is
appealing to me.”

In this way, Beaver BarCamp creates a unique setting for students and community
members to meet new people and share their interests, hobbies and research. Ken
Olsen, a software technician at Hewlett-Packard, enjoys coming to Beaver BarCamp
for that reason.

“If I had to explain BarCamp to someone who hasn't been, I would say it is a
unique opportunity to share information and skills, and make connections with
others who have similar interests,” Olsen says.

Olsen was able to make long-lasting connections during the Beaver BarCamp,
because the cooperative atmosphere allowed attendees to participate in the
instruction. Olsen presented a session about microcomputers, such as Raspberry
Pi and Arduino. When a participant needed help while Olsen was busy, someone
with programming experience stepped in.

“I found not only a great student, but also a great mentor who I invited to come
assist me (at future workshops) as well,” says Olsen.

Students from five different Oregon campuses attended Beaver BarCamp on
Saturday, enabling more collaboration and networking between Oregon
universities. Students and educators from across Oregon’s university system
welcomed the opportunity to socialize and learn with each other.

“This is the second time I’ve come,” says Donovan Finch, a Portland State
University student majoring in computer science. “It’s a great chance to meet
people from the tech community, especially from other universities.”

Students can also benefit from Beaver BarCamp by taking advantage of the
opportunity to practice their speaking skills in a more relaxed atmosphere.
PowerPoint karaoke, a popular session held at the end of the day, is a game
where random PowerPoint slides are taken from the internet and a volunteer gives
the presentation — without knowing what they will present. The volunteer has to
make it up as they go along, allowing students and professionals to practice
impromptu speaking. Russ Earl, a software engineer with Intel, attended Beaver
BarCamp for the first time and participated in PowerPoint karaoke.

*“I'd heard about PowerPoint karaoke but didn't quite know what to expect,” says
Earl. “It was a fun time and a good chance to practice speaking skills.”*
