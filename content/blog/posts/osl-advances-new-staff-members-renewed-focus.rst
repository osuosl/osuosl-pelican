The Oregon State University Open Source Lab recently hired three new full-time
staff members as part of a movement toward expansion as a self-supported campus
entity. The additional staff members will provide comprehensive support in lab
operations, allowing the OSL to increase student opportunities within the lab
and improve the resources it can offer open source projects.

The OSL is home to some of the most well-known open source projects in the world
and facilitates more than 600,000 unique downloads each day. In addition to
hosting external projects, the OSL also contributes to and develops open source
software in-house and provides hosting for projects and Web infrastructure
within the university. To support its efforts, the lab employs several qualified
OSU students who gain professional experience managing open source projects,
maintaining servers and providing customer and user support.

Broadening the lab's staff, says Associate Director of Operations Lance
Albertson, will allow the OSL to enhance its contributions in all of the above
capacities, particularly by providing the professional staff to supervise more
student workers, increasing productivity in the lab.

  “The goal is basically doing more, giving more students the experience and the
  exposure in our environment,” Albertson says. “Full-time staff is really there
  to help students along the way and augment them, and the new restructuring
  allows us to hire more students.”

In addition to serving as mentors to student employees, the new staff members
will fulfill integral roles developing programming code for the lab and
maintaining the OSL's hosting and support services. Hiring new staff has filled
some of the gaps left by the departure of several full-time OSL staff members
within the last year, Albertson says, and also allows the lab to begin the
process of integrating its development and hosting teams.

  “The idea is to have our students doing both the operations side of things and
  the development side of things to give them more experience,” Albertson says.
  “The development team supporting the hosting side of the OSL will also improve
  our hosting services because they will develop tools that will allow more
  automation, which means we can do more with less.”

With this plan for collaboration in mind, Albertson says the new staff members
were selected in part based on ability to adapt and diverse skill in both
software development and systems administration.

New Senior Software Engineer Ken Lett exemplifies the multifaceted experience
Albertson described, coming to the OSL after spending over a decade in various
positions on the OSU campus. Lett has worked as a systems administrator in the
School of `Electrical Engineering and Computer Science`_, completed an
undergraduate degree in physics as a student and worked with
`Central Web Services`_ as a software developer.

Rudy Grigar and Justin Dugger, who joined the lab as senior systems architects,
bring varied experiences of their own to the OSL, both in the private sector and
in educational settings. Grigar, who graduated from OSU in 2010, worked at the
OSL as a student and went on to hold private-sector positions in systems
engineering as well as operations management. Dugger has a background in
educational technology services, having worked as an applications system
administrator at Kansas State University and in source control management at
Kansas' Johnson County Community College.

In addition to adding Lett, Grigar and Dugger to the ranks, the OSL is also
undergoing internal staff reorganization to better address priorities within the
lab. These changes include Albertson's promotion from senior systems architect
to Associate Director of Operations – a move that allows him to use the
knowledge he's developed while managing the OSL's hosting over the past five
years to evaluate the lab's approach to hosting and development tasks and
implement new methods to promote efficiency.

Project Manager Greg Lund-Chaix, who has spent the last several years working
heavily on the Oregon Virtual School District, is also refocusing his efforts
within the lab. Lund-Chaix will still be involved in the virtual school district
project, but will pass some of those responsibilities to others, allowing him to
participate more fully in lab infrastructure planning, customer relations and
student mentoring.

These staff changes accompany efforts to secure the lab as a sustainable entity
and to refine outreach to private sector partners. To enhance OSL
communications, Albertson has begun adding students to the lab with the
establishment of a team of media and marketing students. These students will
manage responsibilities that were assigned to one full-time outreach manager in
the past but have been unattached since the staff member's departure.

  “I saw that it was really an important role to have in our organization, but
  we can certainly do it with students,” says Albertson, who doesn't shy away
  from giving students the opportunity to fulfill varied roles in the lab.

As OSL staff work to optimize the lab's resources and place more emphasis on the
value of the student experience, close mentoring and expanded student
responsibilities will be essential to success. All of the new staff members will
contribute to student development as students and staff collaborate to
strengthen the lab. Lett says he is particularly enthusiastic about the
opportunity to support student growth and the benefits capable students can
bring to the OSL.

  “When I worked with students in the School of Electrical Engineering and
  Computer Science, I saw that we had some really brilliant students,” Lett
  says. “That made me appreciate what a resource we have in our students. I'm
  excited to be part of the process of teaching and fostering that talent.”
