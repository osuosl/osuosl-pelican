On April 28th, 2018, the OSL participated in the Corvallis Maker Fair for the second year in a row. We hosted 2 booths,
the first had demos of programs in Python and Scratch, and the second had a HAProxy cluster with diskless nodes, which
was built and deployed by OSL student JJ Frederick.

Attendees learned about the basics of programming by modifying the source code of the demoed programs to see how it
changed the programs, learned about DevOps basics and saw how easy it was to add their laptops to the cluster as a
diskless node, and also gained an appreciation of open source software.
