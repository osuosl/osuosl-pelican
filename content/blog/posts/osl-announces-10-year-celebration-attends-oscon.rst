**The Open Source Lab (OSL) recently kicked off its 10 year celebration at the
O’Reilly Open Source Conference in Portland July 23 - 26.**

Over the last decade, the OSL has contributed much to the recent growth of the
open source community and is using this milestone to reflect on its past
accomplishments and to create goals for the future. By focusing to ‘Build The
Future’ in three key areas: education, outreach, and research and
infrastructure, the lab will strengthen its position as an open source leader.

“It’s an important milestone," says OSL Director Lance Albertson. "We’re not
just a small group of people anymore but a maturing organization with a smart
staff of both students and non-students."

Icons used to represent the three key areas of the Build The Future initiative:
education, outreach and research & infrastructure.

Further enabling the lab to expand its emphasis on education and fulfill its
mission to promote open source technology globally, the OSL recently joined
Oregon State’s School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS).
This joint effort will help the OSL and the EECS to expand open source
curriculum, mentor an increasing number of students and promote open source
technologies in the public sector.

“It's exciting to see everybody having positive feedback for us moving into
EECS," Albertson says. "Becoming part of the EECS department will enable us to
reach out to more students interested in FOSS (free open source software) or the
OSL than we normally do. Sky’s the limit on what we are capable of doing with
this migration.”

One of the many ways the OSL promotes open source education is by attending
conferences, and as one of the largest open source conferences, OSCON provides
many avenues to do so with over 3,900 attendees and 100-plus company booths. At
the conference, the OSL hosted a booth in the nonprofit pavillion, and students
and staff enjoyed interacting with members of the open source community.

“OSCON was awesome," OSL Student Developer Geoff Corey says. "It was fun working
the booth and telling people from different backgrounds what exactly we do at
the OSL”.

"Hosted by the OSL" signs for the OSL's hosted communities.

The OSL handed out placards to the many open source projects hosted by the lab
that also had booths in the OSCON expo hall, visually demonstrating the impact
the lab has on the open source community. In addition, several community members
stopped by to meet the students and staff that support their projects,
facilitate their downloads, or provide technical help.

Corey thought “it was pretty cool how many big companies knew about us and our
many services we provide to people showed how big our impact really is in the
open source community”.

On Tuesday night of the conference, the lab hosted an alumni party in
appreciation of the students and staff that have contributed to the lab’s
success with 50 guests showing up. Celebrating the OSL’s 10 year celebration,
the OSL provided food along with a slideshow displaying the history of the lab
and Squishymedia generously donated the use of their office space in downtown
Portland to help in the party efforts. The atmosphere felt like a family
reunion, as old friends reconnected and new employees were welcomed.

“Once you are a part of the OSL, you are always a part of it,” says Greg
Lund-Chaix, Squishymedia tech lead and former OSL project manager. “I still use
‘we’ when I refer to the lab.”

According to Albertson, the slideshow made him think about what it took to
create the OSL.

"The OSL became what it is because we had the right connections, opportunities,
people, and sponsors at the right time," Albertson says.
