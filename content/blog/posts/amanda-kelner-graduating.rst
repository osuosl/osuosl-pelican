As of September 8th, my time here at OSU will officially come to an end. As sad as I'll be to leave my life here in
Corvallis and as nerve-racking it is to enter the real world, I realized recently I've spent the last seventeen years
of my life in school and I'm ready to break free!

I'll be leaving with both a degree in English and in music performance, both of which have taught me so much not just
about their respective fields, but about growing up and how to work with what you've got.

While I did not have the skills or the privilege to be a student developer or systems administrator, I feel that my
time here at the OSL has been incredibly valuable. I've learned so much here that I would never have gained from a
class.  The challenges I've faced and the experiences I've had taught me diligence, patience, and flexibility. I firmly
believe that my time here at the OSL has shaped me into a person who is unafraid and excited to leave college.

I'm more than ready to start my new life, but I will miss the friends I've made and the life I've created here at OSU.
The best of luck to my peers and go Beavs!
