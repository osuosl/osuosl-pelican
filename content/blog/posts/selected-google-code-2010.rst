We are thrilled to have been selected as mentoring organization for the
`Google Code-in contest`_.

Right now, we're busy getting our task list up to date on the contest website,
http://google-melange.com.

News

Greg Lund-Chaix has written a blog post aimed at educators about why he's
excited to participate as a mentor for Google Code-in. Greg is one of the key
figures behind the `Oregon Virtual School District`_ program.

Student Information
-------------------

Students can begin participating in the contest on `November 22, 2010`_. In the
interim, now is a great time to peruse the `Official Rules`_ and the contest
`Frequently Asked Questions`_ pages. If you want to talk your would-be mentors
at the OSL, you can find us in our online chat room, #osuosl on Freenode.

If you are not familiar with using Internet Relay Chat (IRC), you may want to
try using the web based client for our chat room. Just visit
http://webchat.freenode.net and then choose a nickname and type #osuosl into the
Channels textbox. Try to choose a nickname that is easy to understand; it is
much easier for mentors to get to know you - and take you seriously - if your
online nickname is leslie or even giraffe rather than senoritasillypantalones.

Other Ways to Contact Us
------------------------

If you're not a fan of online chat, then we recommend you subscribe to the
`Google Code-in mailing lists`_ run by Google, and you can always reach us via
email at **gci at osuosl dot org**

If you're a Facebook fan, you can find updates on our `Facebook page`_. You can
