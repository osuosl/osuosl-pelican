Mozilla’s Firefox 1.0, the newly released Web browser available at
`www.mozilla.org`_, is living quietly in the Oregon State University Open Source
Lab. The Open Source Lab is a world-class facility and data center for Open
Source Software (OSS) knowledge, hosting, infrastructure, development and
collaboration.

Creating an atmosphere of innovation and creativity for students, faculty and
staff is a critical piece of the OSL's mission. “Collaborations there provide
new and innovative solutions that would not have been possible without its
growing success,” said Curt Pederson, vice provost for Information Services.
“The Open Source Lab continues to save the University money at a time of
decreasing state resources.” OSU hosts the software update services, website and
download redirector for Mozilla.

“The open source lab played a big part in our Firefox 1.0 launch with over one
million downloads on its first day of availability,” said Chris Hofmann, Mozilla
Foundation’s Director of Engineering. Firefox 1.0, available for the Windows,
Linux and Mac operating systems in more than a dozen languages, is the result of
two years of work by literally hundreds of programmers. The browser is an
absolute joy to use - smart, fast and very user-friendly, while still offering a
multitude of advanced programmable and customizable functions for those who want
to tinker.

“We began collaborating with Mozilla because we have been mirroring several
other open source projects for many years,” said Scott Kveton, Associate
Director at OSL. “We have helped them grow to over 40 mirrors across the globe
and have developed tools with them to spread the load across all of those
mirrors in a reliable fashion. In the past week there have been about 4 million
downloads of Firefox 1.0”

The Mozilla Foundation, a California-based non-profit organization, is dedicated
to developing open source software that provides users with choice and improved
web experiences. Mozilla has already made considerable inroads into the browser
market. Firefox features a pop-up ad blocker, online fraud protection and the
ability to display several web pages in a single window, using "tabbed
browsing."

“OSU's Open Source Lab has already helped the University save thousands of
dollars by coming up with new solutions to otherwise expensive problems,” said
OSU Provost and Executive Vice President, Sabah Randawah. Scott Kveton couldn’t
agree more. “Mozilla is covering the cost of bandwidth and equipment hosted here
at OSU and we are offering up our expertise as well as student help to provide
these services,” he said. “OSU’s hosting efforts have resulted in several
donations from open source users in the community. We are always looking for
more donations to help provide support for some of the bigger open source
projects that need world-class facilities to deliver their software to the
masses.”

Perhaps the most important thing about these projects is what they bring to OSU
in terms of human capital. “This has helped make OSU the home of open source by
being able to help projects such as Mozilla,” continued Kveton. “Having Mozilla
hosted at OSU has opened up some fantastic learning opportunities for students
as well as added to the synergy occurring here. On Tuesday Mozilla Firefox had
approximately 100 million hits across 7 million unique visitors. The Gentoo
Linux community jumped in to help build out some machines that were hosted at
the open source lab to handle the increased traffic. Without this kind of
collaboration we wouldn't have been able to pull off the 1.0 release.”

OSU’s strategic plan states, “In today’s high technology global economy and
fast-changing world, we will be an engine for economic growth and social
progress in Oregon.”
