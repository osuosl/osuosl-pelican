If you've been following the news, you've likely heard of the
`Open Compute Project`_, Facebook's project to build the most efficient data
center at the lowest possible cost and to share their knowledge with other
companies. Last Friday, Facebook opened the doors of their
`Prineville, Oregon data center`_, inviting a host of dignitaries and members of
the press to tour this newly opened facility and learn more about the Open
Compute Project. The Open Source Lab crew was fortunate enough to be invited to
join this august group for a tour thanks to `David Recordon`_, Facebook's Senior
Open Programs Manager.

   **Little Known Fact: The Prineville data center is actually powered by
   gnomes.**

We kicked off the day with opening ceremonies, including introductions by
several of Facebook's senior staff, members of the Oregon Legislature and the
Mayor of Prineville, Betty Ropple. Finishing off the morning's event, Mayor
Ropple and Facebook's staff pushed a gigantic "Like" button on the opening of
the data center.

   **There's so much "Like" going on in this photo that you can't even see the
   button through the glow.**

..........................

We had a bit of down time before our actual tour began, so we chilled out in the
facility's game room and enjoyed playing Xbox together.

   **A little Halo, anyone?**

And since we wanted to be great guests, our students also fixed one of the
displays that was offline when we arrived.

   **How many sys admins does it take to fix a display? At least four.**

Among the many amazing things we saw on the tour, we were treated to the first
design spec ever created for the data center.

   late one night on a napkin.**

Following the tour, we were treated to an evening of dinner and music in an
enormous party tent. It was particularly exciting to meet so many members of the
Prineville community and hear what a positive impact the data center's creation
has had on the local economy. Sadly, we missed seeing Mark Zuckerberg due to a
long drive back to the office, but the rest of the day more than made up for it.

You can read more about the facility on `Lance Albertson's blog`_, or check out
Greg Lund-Chaix's post on our visit. For more photos, check out

again to David and Facebook for having us!
