**With the open source conference season well underway, OSL students and staff
were excited to attend `Open Source Bridge`_ at the Eliot Center in downtown
Portland from June 18-21. Now in its fifth year, the conference provided a
unique opportunity for the open source community to connect and share with each
other.**

Besides great vegetarian food, one of the ways conference organizers promoted a
feeling of community was with the hacker lounge, sponsored by Intel. Comfortable
seating, plenty of power strips and wifi, a 3-D printer and a Lego table added
to the atmosphere of creativity. For OSL Director Lance Albertson, the hacker
lounge was the most important part of Open Source Bridge.

“It provides a place to start a conversation, work together and find out other
cool projects people are doing,” Albertson says.

Another unique aspect of Open Source Bridge is that it’s completely run by
volunteers. This prompted Jenn Garcia, OSL student outreach manager, to
volunteer this year; she worked as a session chair and assistant volunteer
coordinator. Garcia was impressed with how friendly the open source community
was.

“My favorite thing about volunteering was the people I got to meet,” Garcia
says.

In addition to promoting community, Open Source Bridge offers valuable content
during sessions. Conference organizers created `five tracks`_ for presentations:
Culture, Business, Hacks, Cooking, and Chemistry. Albertson was impressed with
the variety of content offered this year. Session topics he attended ranged from
`Leveling up in DevOps: the Art of Bad Shell Scripts`_ to `Hacking the Academic
Experience`_.

“I really enjoyed the diversity of not only the people attending but also the
session topics,” Albertson says. “I noticed a wider variety of topics this year
than in the past--from advanced technical to sociological topics.”

"rockstar" students.

In the culture track, the OSL presented `How We Mentor “Rock Star” Students`_,
in conjunction with `Portland State University’s CAT`_ presentation Zero to Root
in 12 Months. Albertson and Senior Software Engineer Ken Lett emphasized that
mentoring college students involves much more than teaching code.

“We teach students to collaborate with each other and with the open source
community,” Albertson says. “All of our developers are on IRC, and our students
answer user questions.”

Lett explained that experienced students are encouraged to take leadership roles
on projects at the OSL. Student-to-student mentoring fosters relationships at
the OSL and helps students learn.

“Students really blossom when they get to teach others about cool new things,”
Lett says.

Teaching others is an integral part of Open Source Bridge, and this year’s
conference was no exception. The OSL staff is looking forward to implementing
what we’ve learned--and to attending again next year.

“OS Bridge continues to be the best diverse, community-driven conference in the
world,” Albertson says.

Conference organizers have already started planning the next conference, which
will be held June 24-27, 2014. (Early bird registration is available).
