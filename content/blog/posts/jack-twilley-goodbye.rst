| ``About a decade ago, I was becoming disenchanted with my time in the computer``
| ``industry.  It wasn't *bad*, it just wasn't *me* anymore.  After some serious``
| ``soul searching, I decided to turn my hobby into my next career -- but I knew``
| ``that I needed formal education and training.  After some careful research, I``
| ``narrowed down my choices to two: UC Davis and Oregon State University.  Both``
| ``schools have top-tier records in my new field but it was the Open Source Lab``
| ``that tipped the balance.  After moving to Oregon I haven't once looked back.``
|
| ``After establishing residency and completing my associate degrees (all three)``
| ``at PCC, I finally moved to Corvallis.  I sent Lance my resume in February of``
| ``2013 and was hired the following month as a student software developer.  The``
| ``staff was welcoming and the students were amazing and inspirational.  I felt``
| ``like I was right where I needed to be.  I was surprised at how much pleasure``
| ``I took from mentoring so I got involved with Google's Summer of Code program``
| ``which was a great experience.  I even grew so attached to one of my projects``
| ``that I still support it long after it transitioned to another lab.  Yay PGD!``
|
| ``But all good things must come to an end.  After finishing my undergrad work,``
| ``I went on an internship and came back to start graduate school.  I suspected``
| ``then that I wouldn't be able to have my cake and eat it too and that I would``
| ``have to cut back on my commitments once my research got started, and my time``
| ``at the OSL would probably be the first to go.  This suspicion was reinforced``
| ``after my daughter was born last January and again by the financial situation``
| ``about which we all know.  I decided to wait to resign until after the summer``
| ``in case I was needed to help with the transition and now the summer is over.``
| ``I want to thank all the students with whom I have worked at the OSL.  You're``
| ``what makes the lab what it is: a finishing school for the finest students at``
| ``Oregon State.  I am proud to have worked with you as you launch your careers``
| ``and I firmly believe that you will continue making the world a better place.``
|
| ``Jack.``
