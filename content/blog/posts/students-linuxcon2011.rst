You may recall from our recent newsletter that the OSL team is organizing a
student focused track at the `Linux Foundation's`_ upcoming conference,
`LinuxCon North America 2011`_. Dubbed `Linux Learners Day`_, these sessions for
students will be taught by OSL staff and will focus on fundamentals of Linux,
embedded systems and open source community involvement. LinuxCon NA 2011 will
take place the week of August 15th in Vancouver, B.C., Canada.

Conference registration is now open, and the folks at the Linux Foundation were
kind enough to put together several discounted packages for student attendees.
