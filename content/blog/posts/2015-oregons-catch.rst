This summer the Open Source Lab had three students from around the world working
on open source software through `Google Summer of Code`_. The OSL has
participated in GSoC for nine years, and each year has had its own unique
challenges and successes.

I had an opportunity to work with a student, Chaitanya, on `What's Fresh`_, a
project I originally developed last summer at the OSL for Oregon Sea Grant. With
What's Fresh (which Sea Grant is planning to brand as Oregon's Catch), Sea Grant
wanted to allow visitors to the Oregon coast to be able to find fresh fish
available from fishermen, and had CASS, the new organization the OSL is a part
of, develop the app and backend. Chaitanya worked on the backend, making data
entry easier. It now has several important features, like easier location entry,
search, and inline forms so users don't need to leave the page to add related
items. It is also now themeable, so other organizations can use easily set up a
customized version for their area.

It was initially slow-going as we got more familiar with working with each other
and as he got comfortable working on the project. Since Chaitanya was more
familiar with Python and Django than Javascript, it took a while for things to
start coalescing. However, at the end of the summer, we're both proud of what's
been accomplished and the features added to the project. It was exciting to see
Chaitanya's skills grow, and to myself feel more comfortable in a mentorship
role. We're going to deploy the improved version of the backend after one more
round of code review.

This year, the Open Source Lab will have the opportunity to send one person to
Google's annual Mentorship Summit. We look forward to seeing other mentors
there!
