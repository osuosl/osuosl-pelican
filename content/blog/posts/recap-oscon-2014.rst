The OSL made a strong showing at the `O’Reilly Open Source Conference`_ (OSCON)
this year with the majority of the student employees attending along with all of
the full time staff. The conference was held in Portland, OR, and fell on July
20-24.

The Lab always places a special emphasis on education, and the conference was
certainly an educational experience. The expo hall held dozens of booths filled
with information and demonstrations about open source projects and the companies
that support them.

The expo hall was student developer Evan Tschuy’s favorite part of the
conference. “I liked wandering around the expo hall because there were so many
booths. It was like ‘I’ve heard of that company! Them too! I’ve never heard of
them, what are they about?’”

In between shifts at the OSL booth, staff that attended the conference were
given the opportunity to go to a variety of informational sessions including A
Glimpse of Git’s future, Data Structures and Netflix API: Top 10 Lessons
Learned.

The OSL’s Lucy Wyman attended sessions on graph theory and data structures.
“They were both given by the same guy, Tim Berglund, and he was amazing. When
someone asked a question, he always knew the answer. It’s nice that he knew more
than just his talk; he knew the subject really well.”

Presenting a session can be just as educational as attending a session, and OSL
director Lance Albertson and student Emily Dunham ran a session on DevOps for
University Students, discussing `DevOps Bootcamp`_.

Another important benefit to OSCON is the opportunity for the OSL students to
network within the open source community. Student systems administrator Daniel
Takamori says, “I really enjoyed networking with people and seeing how they use
different open source tools.”

In addition to attending sessions, OSL students were also given the opportunity
to attend the various social events held during OSCON. The Lab hosted a lunch at
Rock Bottom Brewery on Wednesday, with industry partners, alumni and hosted FOSS
projects attending. The OSL and its guests shared good conversation over a
delicious meal.

Wyman states, “The parties were really awesome, not because of the party aspect,
but because that’s really what it’s like to be in the tech industry. It was nice
to meet professionals and talk to people who were as interested in computers as
I am.”

Whether it was gathering information at the booths, attending an informational
session or simply networking with open source professionals, OSCON proved to be
a valuable educational experience for the Open Source Lab. We look forward to
next year!
