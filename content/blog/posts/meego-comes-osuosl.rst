As part a major effort and plan by the worldwide Nokia (Mameo project) and Intel
(Moblin project) to share the MeeGo operating system code with the open source
community, MeeGo has selected OSU's Open Source Lab as its infrastructure home.
Today MeeGo is an open source project hosted by the Linux Foundation that
encourages community contributions in accordance with the best practices of the
open source development model.

MeeGo is an open source, Linux project which brings together the Moblin project,
headed up by Intel, and Maemo, by Nokia, into a single open source activity.
MeeGo integrates the experience and skills of two significant development
ecosystems, versed in communications and computing technologies. According to
the project's web site, they believe "these two pillars form the technical
foundations for next generation platforms and usages in the mobile and device
platforms space."

The MeeGo distribution infrastructure and the operating system base from the
Linux kernel to the OS infrastructure up to the middleware layer. The MeeGo
architecture is based on a common core across the different usage models, such
as netbooks, handheld, in-vehicle, and connected TV. The MeeGo common core
includes the various key subsystems including the core operating system
libraries, the comms and telephony services, internet and social networking
services, visual services, media services, data management, device services, and
personal services.

OSUOSL will provide hosting, infrastructure, and distribution support for the
production environment for the project as well as the build server
infrastructure. Now that MeeGo calls the OSL home, the Lab hopes to get
undergrad students involved in software development for the project. Other
hardware-oriented projects OSL students have taken part in include the One
Laptop Per Child - OLPC - project.

Photos of MeeGo moving day were captured by Senior System Administrator Lance
Albertson and can be viewed on our `Facebook page`_.
