Staff members and students from the Oregon State University Open Source Lab will
represent the lab at Portland’s O’Reilly Open Source Convention (OSCON) July
16-20. An annual open source conference, OSCON engages all aspects of the open
source community with sessions, tutorials, keynote presentations and an expo.

The OSL will be present throughout the conference at the OSCON Expo, where the
lab will have a booth alongside open source leaders like Drupal, Facebook and
Intel. In addition, OSL Associate Director of Operations Lance Albertson will
lead a session on open source private cloud platforms. Albertson plans to
discuss the various features offered by different cloud computing platforms and
offer insight on how to choose a platform that best meets a project’s needs.

Those interested in learning more about the OSL will have the opportunity to
meet members of the lab’s staff and familiarize themselves with lab operations
at the OSL’s Birds of a Feather (BoF) session. The BoF is an informal meeting
between students and staff from the lab and community or industry members who
are interested in the lab’s operations, projects or future. The OSL booth will
also present opportunity for OSCON attendees to learn about the lab. OSL student
employees at the booth will answer questions, interact with the community and
distribute OSL swag.

While participating in OSCON, the OSL will also celebrate its first alumni
reception, welcoming students and staff who worked with the OSL in the past and
supported the lab’s success. More than 55 OSL alumni have gone on to successful
careers in the technical industry, where they have joined top companies, created
their own start-ups and made innovative contributions to open source
technologies. Three of those alumni will lead sessions at OSCON: Deborah Bryant,
the OSL’s former public sector communities manager; former Outreach Manager
Leslie Hawthorn; and former student employee Brandon Phillips.
