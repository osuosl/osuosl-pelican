Students from India, Poland and the United Kingdom will work on projects for the
OSL this summer. The Oregon State University Open Source Lab has accepted four
college students from around the world as `Google Summer of Code 2013`_
participants. The four students will work on projects for the OSL over the
summer with Google’s sponsorship and OSL staff members’ mentoring and
supervision.

The OSL has not had four GSOC students since 2010. OSL Director Lance Albertson
attributes this year’s increased number of students, compared to only one in
2012, to a greater variety of available projects.

“We had more projects that people were interested in this year,” Albertson says.
“I think this year’s group of students is going to be pretty good; each of them
have been proactive about contacting us and excited about working on their
projects.”

Polish automation control and robotics student Piotr Banaszkiewicz will be
working with the lab through Google summer programs for the third consecutive
year, and his project will focus on improving the modularity, packaging and
installation of the OSL’s `Ganeti Web Manager`_. Two students from India will
also work on GWM-related projects; Ahmed Shabib Bolwar, a computer science
engineering student, will add a GWM provider to `Vagrant`_, while Pranjal
Mittal, who is studying electronics engineering, will add visualization to
clusters, nodes and virtual machines in GWM. A fourth student, Mark Antony
Holland, who is from the United Kingdom and currently studying computer science
in Spain, will work on incorporating functionality and user-interface
improvements to the OSL-developed `Android OpenConferenceWare app`_.

The students will be mentored by OSL full-time developer Ken Lett, student
developer Justin Noah and Albertson. Aside from having an array of time zones to
accommodate this year, Albertson says working with GSOC students abroad is
similar to collaborating with student employees in the lab.

“It’s kind of like what we do with students here but compressed,” he says.
“We’re interacting with students from all over the world, and understanding
their cultural differences too.”

Albertson hopes working with professionals through the Open Source Lab will help
the students learn communication and teamwork skills, as well as offer them the
experience of following a project through from draft to completion. And while
they’re gaining valuable real-world experience, he says, the students will also
be helping to advance development projects at the OSL.

“Everything they do is going to be beneficial to the lab long-term,” Albertson
says. “And I hope in their careers being able to say they had that experience
will help them.”
