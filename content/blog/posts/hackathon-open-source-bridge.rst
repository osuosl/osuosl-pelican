The Open Source Lab is organizing a Hackathon (code sprint) at the
`Open Source Bridge conference`_, June 17-19th at the Oregon Convention Center
in Portland. We’re bringing people together to help out
`Sunlight Lab’s Fifty States Project`_. If you’re interested in helping promote
government openness and transparency, this is your chance.

**What**

Part of the non-partisan `Sunlight Foundation`_, Sunlight Labs is an open source
development team that builds technology to make government more transparent and
accountable. They have been building the Fifty States Project with the help of
volunteers around the country. The project aims to provide parsers and an API
for legislative data from each of the fifty state governments in the U.S. This
is a local version of their already successful `OpenCongress.org`_ which
provides the same data from the federal government.

**Where**

The hackathon will take place at the Open Source Bridge conference. Open Source
Bridge is a new conference for developers working with open source technologies
and for people interested in learning the open source way. It is an entirely
volunteer organized conference. Open Source Bridge is providing a Hacker Lounge,
providing a great environment to hack in 24 hours a day during the conference.

The hacker lounge is located at the **Hilton Portland & Executive Tower, 921 SW
Sixth Avenue, Portland, Oregon**

**When**

The hacker lounge opens at 9am on June 17th and is open round the clock until
12am, June 19th.

* Project Intro: Anytime between 3pm - 8pm June 17th
* Coding: any time till the end of the conference

**Who**

We’re looking for any programmers of any level, interested in promoting openness
and transparency in government. No prior experience with the project is needed,
but feel free to check out the project wiki. Fifty States is written in python
but other languages are welcome as well.
