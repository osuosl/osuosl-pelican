`Linux.com`_ is now being run by the `Linux Foundation`_ and, along with most of
the other Linux Foundation infrastructure, is hosted at the OSU Open Source Lab.

The site has historically been a source for articles, information, and online
forums about the Linux operating system. Under the Linux Foundation, the site
will undergo a face lift in the coming months. An IdeaForge site has been
launched at http://ideaforge.linux.com/ where you can view and make suggestions
about what you would like to see on the future Linux.com site.
