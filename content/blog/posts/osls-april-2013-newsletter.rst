**Letter from the Director**

*Dear Friends,*

After working for nearly six years as the Oregon State University Open Source
Lab’s lead systems engineer and the associate director, I became the lab’s new
director in January. My involvement in the open source community began in 2003
with the `Gentoo Linux distribution`_, and I am excited for the opportunity I
will have to continue promoting and supporting FOSS in my new role. The OSL is
unique for its heavy reliance on a student workforce to power the lab, and I
plan to find new ways to further develop and expand our students’ abilities.

This year marks the 10th anniversary of the OSL and we're proud to see what
we've accomplished over the past decade. I want to extend my thanks to everyone
who has helped and contributed to the lab during those 10 years. It’s amazing to
think how much the lab has impacted the open source ecosystem during that time.
We can only imagine what the next 10 years will be like, but I know that the lab
will continue to be a key player in the FOSS ecosystem.

In other news, the lab has been selected for a seventh straight year as a
`Google Summer of Code 2013 mentoring organization`_. I'm proud to see the lab
participating in this program again and look forward to interacting with
students from all over the world. In addition we had another successful
`Beaver BarCamp`_ this past weekend with more than 150 people in attendance,
including a regiment of at least 35 students from Portland State University and
several past OSL students and staff. We look forward to having our next Beaver
BarCamp **October 12, 2013**.

In closing, I would like to thank all of the lab staff and students who work
hard on a daily basis to improve the FOSS ecosystem. They do amazing work!

| Best wishes,
| *Lance Albertson*

New Projects at the OSL
-----------------------

*The list of projects and communities the OSL supports through hosting and other
services is always growing. Notable projects that have recently found a home at
the OSL include:*

**Systers**

A thriving email community for women in computing, Systers has been connecting
and supporting women in computer science since 1987. The project came to the OSL
this year in need of a managed hosting provider with experience hosting Mailman
mailing lists. The lab is now hosting two virtual machines for Systers, one for
their production mailman lists and a second one for open source development of
patches that will eventually become part of Mailman 3.0.

**Python Software Foundation**

As a large foundation, the Python Software Foundation has been previously
scattered about various data centers around the world. PSF was looking for a
more permanent home for many of its services and chose the OSL. The lab has
hosted a Ganeti private cloud for PSF since spring 2012, and the project has
continued moving various services to the OSL-managed cloud.

*Eric Zounes has been a student system administrator at the Open Source Lab
since June 2012. He works primarily on the Oregon Virtual School District
project testing site upgrades and providing general system administration. Here,
Eric answers some questions about his work at the OSL and what he’s planning for
the future following his graduation this spring.*

**What do you enjoy about contributing to ORVSD?**

The ORVSD project is a fun technical challenge since we are building our own
platform as a service. I also enjoy providing service to the participating
Oregon public schools. Facilitating the education system in any way is important
to me.

**How has working at the OSL benefitted you?**

I've learned a tremendous amount in such a short period of time working at the
OSL. Students are immersed in an environment where each of us are passionate
about open source. Many of the problems we solve never come up in academia, so
the amount of practical experience we get really complements the content we
learn in classes.

**What are your plans for next year?**

I plan on working for Mozilla on their Web Operations team. I also plan on
contributing to several open source projects and taking some time off to travel.
