#. **Apache Software Foundation** |br|
   `The Apache Software Foundation`_ manages the development of many open

   one of the OSL’s first hosted projects, coming aboard in 2003. The OSL
   provides hosting for the ASF's operational infrastructure. |br| |br|

#. **Linux Foundation** |br|
   `The Linux Foundation`_ promotes, protects and advances Linux. To achieve
   these tasks, the Linux Foundation provides legal services to Linux
   developers, collaborates on the Linux Standards Base, hosts events for the
   Linux community and provides public relations regarding Linux. The OSL
   hosts the Linux Foundation's infrastructure including websites, email and
   development machines. |br| |br|

#. **phpBB** |br|

   Gentoo Linux is a distribution built on a customizable foundation, allowing
   users to build a Linux system exactly the way they need it. The Gentoo
   community was the first hosted client of the OSL, and it still utilizes
   many servers and development platforms here. The OSL provides colocation
   hosting and FTP mirroring services for the `Gentoo Foundation`_, including
   colocation hosting for Polyp, a Chromebook being used by Gentoo for ARM
   development. |br| |br|

#. **Drupal** |br|

   installations worldwide, including whitehouse.gov, npr.org, and
   examiner.com, along with several at Oregon State. When Drupal needed
   assistance with a Web server that was crippled under the load of its own
   popularity, the OSL -- along with the financial help of Drupal's users --
   built a cluster for Drupal's websites that can scale along with its growth.

   the advancement of free, open source software and content. The Fedora

   other needs that Fedora often runs into during the course of building a new
   Fedora release. |br| |br|

   people worldwide. It is used by many open source projects and is used
   extensively by the OSL. `Freenode`_ contains around 40,000 channels.The OSL
   hosts a Web server for Freenode. |br| |br|

#. **Python Software Foundation** |br|
   A nonprofit membership organization devoted to advancing open source
   technology, the `Python Software`_ Foundation’s mission is to promote,
   protect and advance the Python programming language. The OSL provides
   hosting for the PSF servers and the speed.python.org benchmarking server.

   `CentOS`_ is an enterprise-class Linux distribution operating system
   derived from sources freely provided to the public. CentOS developers
   provide technical support through chat rooms, mailing lists and web forums.
   The OSL hosts the CentOS master mirrors. |br| |br|

#. **Debian** |br|
   `Debian`_ GNU/Linux is a distribution known for its stability and roots in
   the free software philosophy. Created in 1993 by Ian Murdock, Debian is now
   supported by volunteer developers around the world. The OSL hosts the
   server for bugs.debian.org, along with some of their internal
   infrastructure. The lab also hosts development environments for MIPS and
   PPC. |br| |br|
