Last month, Oregon State University Open Source Lab Operations Manager, Jeff
Sheltren, headed to Chicago for `Flourish! Open Source Conference`_, put on by
the University of Illinois, Chicago. There was a great crowd at Flourish with a
number of excellent speakers and demonstration/learning sessions going on
throughout the two day conference.

Jeff spoke about the OSUOSL including the history, current projects, and some of
the cool open source projects hosted at the lab. There was a lot of interest in
the audience about forming open source groups at other universities and
potential collaboration with the OSUOSL.
