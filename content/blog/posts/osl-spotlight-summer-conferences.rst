The open source community is driven by the people who use, change and support
open source software. This summer, members of the Open Source Lab staff enjoyed
opportunities to connect with those people face-to-face at annual open source
events. Lab staff and students attended the Portland conferences Open Source
Bridge and O’Reilly Open Source Convention, where they presented talks, hosted a
booth to represent the OSL and talked shop with everyone from recreational users
to industry developers.

“Conferences are a way to interface with our community; not only our users, but
people who know of us and like what we do, we can hear from them things that
they want,” says OSL Associate Director of Operations Lance Albertson. “It's
just great to be able to interact with people.”

To kick off the summer, Albertson and other staff members attended Open Source
Bridge, a volunteer-supported conference held June 26-29 at the Eliot Center in
downtown Portland. Hundreds of community members, corporate representatives and
people thinking about and contributing to open source gathered to share ideas
and discuss technology. The annual conference focuses on the theme of open
source citizenship, bringing individuals from a number of sectors, programming
languages and backgrounds together to collaborate on what they all have in
common: open source.

At Open Source Bridge, Albertson presented a talk on private cloud platforms,
Project Manager Greg Lund-Chaix spoke about open source technologies in K-12
education and student developer Corbin Simpson presented to a crowded room of
more than 50 people on translating lessons from esoteric programming languages
into methods for improving common code bases. Lund-Chaix then teamed up with
Senior System Administrator Rudy Grigar and Senior Software Engineer Ken Lett to
deliver a multifaceted presentation on DevOps. The three spoke from different
perspectives in open source development, management and hosting to communicate a
unified message about how collaborative thinking between developers and
operations managers can improve project success.

“Developers and system operations people need to understand both sides to
perform their jobs more effectively and collaborate for better end results,”
Grigar said during the talk.

Kenn Wilson, a contract developer based in Portland, said after attending the
OSL’s DevOps talk that the concept of integrating systems and development work
wasn’t new to him, but that Lund-Chaix, Grigar and Lett brought new ideas to his
attention.

“One thing I did find really interesting is using something like cloud computing
to test your system,” Wilson says. “That’s something I’ve never thought of
before, to test your systems rather than your code.”

Talks presented by the OSL and others at Open Source Bridge, Wilson says, are
significant contributions to communal and individual knowledge.

“You can learn about things you weren’t aware of,” Wilson says. “It helps
everybody here in a very tangible way.”

That commitment to supporting the open source community won Albertson the
conference’s highest honor at its official party June 27. Albertson was
presented with the Truly Outstanding Open Source Citizen award for his efforts
to introduce students to open source technology and the OSL’s continued support
of numerous open source projects.

“I think it's awesome,” Albertson says of his award. “I was completely caught
off guard but I think it's a great honor to be able to have that award.”

Albertson says he is passionate about bringing students into the lab and
exposing them to open source technology because he appreciates how strong of a
resource the OSL can be for students.

“When I went through school I wished I had an OSL, and now I get to provide the
resource I so wished I had to all these amazing students,” Albertson says. “It’s
a great feeling.”

Former OSL student employee Brandon Phillips, who attended Open Source Bridge
and delivered two of his own presentations, says Albertson was an apt choice for
the Truly Outstanding Open Source Citizen award given his integral role within
the lab.

“Lance has been a solid and steady hand inside of the OSL for years now, and it
is an important role given the huge scope of projects that the OSL helps keep up
and on the Internet,” Phillips says. “It is a well-deserved award.”

After wrapping up Open Source Bridge, OSL staff had only a few short weeks to
prepare for OSCON. Hosted by O’Reilly Media at the Oregon Convention Center June
16-20, OSCON continued the conversation about open source software that began at
Open Source Bridge, but -- with more than 3,000 attendees -- on a much larger
scale.

The OSL was among nearly 100 exhibitors at the conference expo, which featured
top open source industry partners as well as many open source projects hosted by
the OSL. Students and full-time staff interacted with visitors to the OSL’s
booth throughout the conference, sharing information about the lab’s current
projects, explaining the OSL’s innovative integration of student employees and
enjoying the opportunity to connect with other open source enthusiasts.

“It was good to interact with the corporate world and meet people
professionally,” says Dean Johnson, a sophomore who began working at the lab in
June. “People were really grateful for our mirrors and what we do, and it was
nice to feel like what I’m doing here is making a difference and helping the
community.”

Many stopped by the OSL booth simply to meet the students and staff members who
have helped support their projects, facilitated their downloads or provided
technical support in person. Todd Richmond, who works in information technology
with Lincoln County, Ore., already knew about the OSL’s services, but visited
the booth to say thank you.

“I use the OSL’s FTP mirrors daily,” Richmond says. “I think it’s a tremendous
service, not just for other universities and governments, but for everyone.
Having a regional site like that where we can grab security updates and things
like that is fantastic.”

While at OSCON, Albertson delivered a talk on private cloud computing, and all
of the OSL members in attendance hosted a Birds of a Feather session to
introduce interested conference attendees to the lab and to offer those who
already follow the lab insight on how OSL infrastructure continues to develop
and improve.

As part of OSCON week, the lab also held its first alumni gathering in
appreciation of the students and staff who helped the OSL become the resource
that it is today. More than 40 of the people who have been part of the OSL story
gathered to reconnect with old friends, celebrate the lab’s achievements and
honor the first director of the OSL, Shay Dakan, who passed away just over a
week before the conference began.

At the alumni event, OSL Director Curt Pederson, who has been part of the lab’s
work since its beginnings, offered his thoughts on the group of people who have
fueled the OSL’s progress over the years and his hopes for the future. Pederson
emphasized the lab’s pristine track record for turning out students who go on to
great success in the technical industry, as evinced by the caliber of people,
many of whom represented top companies including Google, Rackspace and Mozilla,
who were in the room.

“The alumni event reminded me of why we started the OSL nine years ago, and that
the true value of our work comes from providing our students with real industry
experience,” Pederson says. “Having 55 of our former students now in key roles
across the open source community confirms that the most important thing we do
for the community is mentor the next generation of open source leaders.”
