The Oregon State University community shared its talents, knowledge and ideas
this past Saturday, October 29th, in the Kelley Engineering Center during
`Beaver BarCamp 8`_ (BBC 8), an ad-hoc gathering born from the desire for people
to share and learn in an open environment. It is an intense event with
discussions, demos, and interaction from attendees.

More than 130 people met for the second and final Corvallis BarCamp of the year,
hosted by the `OSU Open Source Lab`_. There were sessions for many tastes at BBC 8.

The OSL’s Lead Systems Administrator/Architect, `Lance Albertson`_, hosted a
talk about `Ganeti`_ and what people should know about its virtualization
capabilities. `Corbin Simpson`_, a veteran OSL student developer, let his nerd
flag fly free with his own session, “Corbin Code: how to improve code
maintainability.”

BBC 8's flagship sponsor Mozilla launched the day with a `web security`_
workshop. `Andy Rosic`_, CEO of Portland, ORE., based Thumb Arcade, treated
attendees to a speed hackathon touching on `Geo, Mobile and Augmented Reality`_.

Some attendees took a different route by hosting non-technical sessions,
including “Cheap Home Brewing” and “Planning and Cooking for Yourself to Save
Money.” A good and delicious time was had by all.

Attendees and those unable to come to BBC 8 were able to follow along on
Twitter: @Beaverbarcamp. You can still check out updates from the unconference

Many thanks to all of our attendees for a fabulous BBC 8! Most of all, thanks to
our generous sponsors, especially Mozilla, for their support of the event. We
could not have made the day possible without your support!

We'll see you at BBC 9 in spring 2012!
