The Give 6 fund raising program which was launched last year has completed with
great success. Friends of the Oregon State University Open Source Lab were
invited to make a gift in honor of our sixth anniversary. Responses came from 88
unique donors representing 27 U.S. states and 17 different countries. Many
donors added words of appreciation: "The support we've received, in hardware,
bandwidth, and from the volunteers and employees of the Open Source Lab, have
been outstanding." "By supporting efforts like the Open Source Lab, the
university is helping teach, innovate, and support our future."

We are happy to see such a great outpouring of support from our hosted projects,
as well as individual and corporate donors. Thanks to all your support, we
surpassed $350,000 in donations during the seven month duration of the program
(December 2009 through June 2010). We exceeded $650,000 in cash donations for
the entire fiscal year (July 2009 through June 2010) – this does not include the
many in-kind donations that we received such as bandwidth and hardware.

A huge thanks from all of us at the Open Source Lab goes out to those who
supported us last year! We continue to rely upon donations to support our
activities at the Lab, however we are working to establish other means of income
so that we are able to continue providing services to the open source community
without being completely reliant upon external donations. For example, we are
experimenting with grants, paid development on open source projects, and other
such endeavors which allow us to remain focused on supporting open source
software around the globe.
