From Support to Success

When staff members at the Oregon State University Open Source Lab were working
with creators of the Drupal content management system to provide free hosting
services to the overloaded project in 2005, crisis hit. A server meltdown left
all Drupal websites down for two days, emphasizing the project’s need for
further support and motivating the community behind the open source project to
donate double the amount needed to purchase a new server to be hosted at the
OSL.

As soon as the lab began hosting Drupal, two student system administrators,
Narayan Newton and Eric Searcy, attacked the task of expanding the project’s
overloaded infrastructure, building a cluster for Drupal’s websites that could
be scaled with the company’s growth. And its popularity continued to grow. While
Newton and Searcy handled the infrastructure needs, Drupal contributors were
able to focus on the project, resulting in its size tripling following the move
to the OSL.

  “Had the OSL not stepped up and offered hosting, we probably would have had to
  find hosting of our own and paid for it, which would have put too much
  financial burden on the project at the time and severely hampered the
  project,” says Jacob Redding, Drupal Association executive director.

Over the next two years, students headed up an overhaul of Drupal’s
infrastructure, adjusting solutions to meet rising growth and making Drupal more
easily available for download around the world. Newton worked to optimize the
database infrastructure, while Searcy used load balancers and multiple Web nodes
to create a formidable Web architecture. When Rudy Grigar arrived as a student
system administrator at the lab in 2007, the crisis period had ended, but he was
able to continue Newton and Searcy’s work, developing new features for Drupal
and using automated tools to increase efficiency.

  “It didn't sink in until a few months before graduating from OSU how big
  Drupal was,” Grigar says. “I had the opportunity to attend DrupalCon San
  Francisco and witnessed just how large and global the Drupal community had
  become.”

While they helped Drupal attain the stability needed to weather extreme growth
successfully, Grigar says the experience of working on the project was equally
valuable for the students involved.

  “The industry experience is priceless,” he says. “It's an amazing thing to be
  responsible for successes and failures as a student with something as popular
  as Drupal.”

Now, Drupal has achieved both success and stability, and is one of the largest
open source projects hosted by the OSL. While server overload is no longer a
concern for Drupal, Redding says the association’s relationship with the OSL has
continued to yield unexpected benefits, largely because of the lab’s commitment
to training students through hands-on experience.

  “Over the years what the OSL has provided has been over and above just fair
  hosting,” Redding says. “It’s been a great environment where people can come
  in and learn about hosting and about open source projects. Had the OSL only
  provided hosting we would not have been able to get such great people to work
  on our team.”

After working on the Drupal project at the OSL, Newton went on to work as an
administrator in the Drupal Association, while Grigar spent time after
graduation working on Drupal infrastructure through Tag1 Consulting and Acquia.

  “Without the OSL we wouldn't have had the opportunity to learn what we did,”
  Grigar says. “Not only were we able to help a project like Drupal grow as
  college students; we developed sought-after skill sets that we've used to
  spread Drupal and open source software to others.”

Current student employees at the OSL continue to learn by maintaining projects
like Drupal and by providing the more comprehensive support still needed by
other projects that are in earlier stages of development. This service to
growing projects, Redding says, is especially important within the open source
community.

  “The OSL has always been an essential part of any project and has fostered the
  success and accelerated the growth of many open source projects,” Redding
  says. “It’s amazing that it exists. It’s almost necessary to have a service
  like the OSL; it’s a very rare, very respected resource.”

Though Drupal has moved past the growing pains that brought it to the OSL, the
relationship between the lab and the Drupal Association has deepened through
mutual support. Dries Buytaert, the original creator and project lead for
Drupal, serves on the OSL Advisory Council, and student employees gain
experience by working on Drupal both at the OSL and as interns with Drupal and
its partners.

And the support the OSL offered to help Drupal reach success has had positive
effects for the university as well. When the lab offered Drupal as a stable
option, OSU began utilizing it for university websites.

  “The campus uses Drupal and benefits profoundly,” says OSL Director Curt
  Pederson.

By switching to Drupal content management system and using open source tools for
other needs including spam filtering and security, the university was able to
save thousands of dollars initially, and continues to benefit from free and
low-cost maintenance.

The fact that Drupal no longer needs the intensive support services that were
necessary when the project arrived at the OSL is part of the lab’s goal to
foster the success of projects that will eventually be able to support
themselves. According to Lance Albertson, OSL associate director of operations,
the lab’s function to drive the growth of emerging projects is perfectly
illustrated in the trajectory of Drupal.

  “We’ve had similar successes in the past such as our experience with Mozilla,”
  Albertson says. “They were in a bad position infrastructure-wise and our
  students at the time kicked in and helped them fix their issues. Many of those
  students and staff still work at Mozilla today in leading roles. Drupal is
  another great example of how the OSL helped a growing community expand,
  allowing them to focus on improving their project. Seeing the success and
  impact of the community around the world is the reason many of us at the lab
  love what we do.”

As the lab works to promote the growth of the next generation of open source
projects, Redding says he’s excited to see the collaboration between Drupal and
the OSL continue to expand.

  “We’d love more people to get involved with our project and we’d love for them
  to come from OSU,” Redding says. “I think there are some really great
  opportunities there that you’re not going to get anywhere else. I can’t think
  of a single place in the world where you can get that kind of experience other
  than the OSL.”
