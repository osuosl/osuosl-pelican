OSCON
-----

We were very excited to have OSCON back in Portland this year! Not only did this
mean we got to share our wonderful city with many of our open source friends
(Three OSLers live around Portland!), but Portland is also close enough to
campus that we could bring up a number of OSL student employees and OSU CS
students. It was great seeing our students meet people in the expo hall and
share some of their experiences.

The OSL was represented in a few different sessions at OSCON. Lance Albertson
joined Justin Erenkrantz (Apache Software Foundation) and John Hawley (Linux
Foundation / kernel.org) for a talk on scaling open source project
infrastructure on a shoestring budget. Deb Bryant opened up the Health IT Track
and led a panel on open source voting solutions as well.

Deb didn't stop at simply participating in sessions. She also received one of
five `O'Reilly Open Source Awards`_ in recognition of her work in getting open
source software into state and local government agencies. Please join us in
congratulating Deb on this exciting award!

We ended the week at OSCON with a small bus tour which took a group down to
Corvallis to see our data center, and then stopped on the way back at Willamette
Valley Vineyards for lunch and wine tasting. The wine was great, and the company
on the bus was even better. We even did a network boot of Linux over the bus's
Wi-Fi using boot.kernel.org. We've got pictures up `on Flickr`_! Our thanks go
out to Aruba Networks for sponsoring the tour.

New projects
------------

We've brought in a number of new projects during 2010, including `CONNECT`_,
`OpenEFS`_, `Meego`_ and `OSGeo`_, just to name a few. For further information
on projects hosted at OSUOSL, please see `our Communities page`_.

Donations update
----------------

**Give 6 program ends successfully** -- We raised over $350,000 during the 6 for
6 program. Thank you all for your support! For more information on the Give 6
program and our future funding plans, please see our recent news story.

Virtualization Migration Complete
---------------------------------

We have migrated all of our hosted virtual machines onto new hardware and
management software. We are now using `ganeti`_ for VM management on top of KVM
virtualization. We are currently running 65 virtual machines on four physical
servers using DRBD to replicate disks between them for failover. The hardware is
much faster than the previous virtualization hardware we had in place, and many
hosted projects have noted a nice performance increase after the migration.

GOSCON 2010
-----------

This year, GOSCON returns to Portland, Oregon on October 27 & 28. The conference
venue is the Nines Hotel, located at Pioneer Square in downtown Portland. Early
registration and the call for speakers are now open, and program tracks have
been announced! More info on GOSCON, including a sign-up for the conference
newsletter, can be found at http://goscon.org.
