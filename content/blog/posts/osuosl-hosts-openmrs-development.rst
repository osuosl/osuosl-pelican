OpenMRS is an open source electronic medical record system framework. Led by the
`Regenstrief Institute`_ and `Partners In Health`_, OpenMRS has been implemented
in several countries including South Africa, Kenya, Rwanda, Lesotho, Zimbabwe,
Mozambique, Uganda, and Tanzania.

The Oregon State University Open Source Lab is providing hosting for the OpenMRS
Development Website including a Trac instance at http://dev.openmrs.org and the
OpenMRS subversion repository. We are happy to provide services to OpenMRS and
support their efforts in bringing usable medical information systems to
developing countries where HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis are a major
problem.

"We've been growing the OpenMRS community for over four years now, largely
building up our online community presence in our spare time. Fortunately, we
grew beyond the point where this hosting approach made sense for us.  In our
conversations with the top open source projects, Oregon State University's Open
Source Lab was repeatedly introduced as a perfect transition strategy for an
organization like ours.  I've found them to be the perfect balance of fun and
easy to work with as well as professional when it counts.  We are confident in
their ability to manage our mission critical code repository and online web
presence.  I couldn't recommend them highly enough!" **-- Paul Biondich,
co-founder, OpenMRS**
