The OSL partners with `Ampere Computing`_ to host `AARCH64`_-based servers in order to provide an open platform for
innovation to the open source community. Current projects embrace open software projects ranging from KVM to OpenStack
and open collaboration with open source based ISV and distribution partners, such Red Hat, SUSE and Ubuntu, who support
the latest AARCH64 hardware via production and development (Fedora, CentOS, OpenSUSE, and Debian) distributions.

Members of the community can use these `Ampere Computing eMAG`_ or `Ampere Computing Mt. Collins`_ AARCH64 servers to
develop and test open source projects on the AARCH64 Architecture platform and in a AARCH64 environment.

OpenStack
---------

Our primary resource is an OpenStack based cluster offering AARCH64 instances running on KVM and providing access via
OpenStack's API and GUI interface. These shared systems are intended for functional development and continuous
integration work, but are not ideal for performance testing. We start projects out with a small quota, but can increase
given resource availability and justification.

To request access to an OpenStack AARCH64 instance, use our `AARCH64 OpenStack request form`_.
