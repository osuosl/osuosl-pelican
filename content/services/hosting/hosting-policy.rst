Services
--------

In order to support `our mission`_, the Oregon State University Open
Source Lab provides hosting services for the Open Source Community. These
services include:

- Managed/unmanaged hosting – anything from a shared Web host, to a virtual
  machine, to dedicated hardware.
- FTP mirroring from our national mirror network.
- Various other services such as email relay, DNS, database servers, backups and
  monitoring. See our services page for more information:
  http://osuosl.org/services/hosting.

Conditions of Use Policy
------------------------

All use of Oregon State University Open Source Lab (OSUOSL) computing and
network resources must meet the conditions set forth in the `OSU Acceptable Use
Policy for Computing Resources`_.

.. _OSU Acceptable Use Policy for Computing Resources:
  http://fa.oregonstate.edu/gen-manual/acceptable-use-university-computing-resou
  rces


When granted use of a computing resource at OSUOSL, it is expected that the
resource will only be used for the specific use or project that was represented
when use of the resource was granted. If the scope or purpose of the project
changes at any time, you must contact OSUOSL immediately to inform us of such a
change.

OSUOSL reserves the right to disable accounts, disconnect systems and/or
discontinue hosting for any reason at any time.


Potential Hosted Projects
-------------------------

Our hosting services are limited to open source projects and related community
sites. In general, this refers to licenses approved by the Open Source
Initiative (OSI), which maintains a list of approved licenses on their website:
http://www.opensource.org/. Projects that release under other “open” licenses
which are not OSI-approved will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

We provide hosting for various types of projects. Some are software/code-based
projects such as Linux distributions, software programs, etc., while others are
more community/communication-based projects such as IRC servers, forum/community
sites dedicated to open source, etc.

We typically try not to provide hosting for smaller projects which could be
hosted at other “free” hosting sites such as SourceForge or Google Code. We do
not have the infrastructure set up to provide hosting to thousands of smaller
projects, but would prefer to focus our efforts on hosting those projects that
have grown too large to fit in at SourceForge but cannot (yet) afford to pay for
hosting at a hosting company.

We decide on hosting requests by looking at many factors. One of the main things
we look for in a project/site is that it shows a current or potential
significant positive impact to the open source community. This is, of course,
highly subjective, but we will do our best to look at all incoming hosting
requests on an individual basis to decide if we think this condition is met.
For development-based projects we also feel that it is important to have an
active development community, which is usually characterized by both the number
of developers and the frequency of code updates and/or releases. For
community-based projects, an active, helpful user community is important.

We will periodically monitor our hosted projects to ensure that they continue to
meet the requirements listed above. If a project becomes inactive or changes its
purpose, we may discontinue hosting. All hosted projects must abide by our
`Conditions of Use Policy`_.

Funding Model
-------------

We are able to provide hosting services thanks to the donations we receive from
individuals and companies around the world. Without these donations, we would
not be able to provide this valuable service to the open source community. For
more information on how to support the OSL, please visit our `Donate page`_.
