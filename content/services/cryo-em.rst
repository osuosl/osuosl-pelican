The OSU Open Source Lab (OSUOSL) and Center for Quantitative Life Sciences (CQLS) partner with IBM and OpenPOWER in order to provide a download for a new package: Cryo-EM. 

The software stack download provides an Anaconda folder with all the needed software compiled and working for PPC64LE. The Cryo-EM package set provides primary access to the RELION (for REgularized LIkelihood OptimizatioN) software stack used in High Resolution Electron Microscopy imaging. RELION is widely-used as a processing software package for macromolecular structure determination by single-particle analysis of cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM). RELION uses an empirical Bayesian approach to refinement of the 3D reconstructions or 2D class averages from cryo_EM data. The pipeline is GPU enabled and can reduce processing times when run on Power9 servers with V100 GPU.
