`Hosting Services`_
-------------------

The OSL provides world-class `hosting services`_ for the Linux operating system,
the Apache Software Foundation, the Drupal content management system and more
than 150 other leading open source `communities`_.

We understand that every open source project has different hosting needs. We
work with each project we host to meet those needs and to create an
infrastructure that will grow along with the project. `Read more about our
hosting services`_.

`Supercell`_
------------

.. _Supercell: /services/supercell


Supercell is an on-demand virtualization and continuous integration resource
from the OSL. We have created this cluster for use by open source projects that
need to run software tests regularly but may not have access to the appropriate
hardware or the funds to pay for outsourcing this service. Supercell allows
projects to do manual testing to verify that a submitted patch has actually
fixed the intended bug or to determine that their software package runs
correctly on a particular operating system or distribution. The service also
allows projects to test their software in a large cluster using several VMs
concurrently. `Read more about our Supercell testing hosting services`_.

`PowerLinux Development Hosting`_
---------------------------------

.. _PowerLinux Development Hosting: /services/powerdev


The OSL partners with `IBM`_ to host `POWER7`_-based servers, making partitions
available to the open source community. Community members can use these POWER7
servers to develop and test open source projects on the Power architecture
platform and in a PowerLinux environment. These systems are intended for
functional development and testing work, but are not to be used for performance
testing. `Read more about our PowerLinux development hosting services`_
