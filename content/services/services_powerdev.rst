The Open Source Lab partners with `IBM`_ to host `POWER`_ based servers in order
to provide an open platform for innovation to the open source community. Current
projects embrace open software projects ranging from KVM to OpenStack and open
collaboration with `OpenPOWER Foundation`_ partners, including `Mellanox`_,
`Ubuntu`_ and `Google`_, and open source based ISV and distribution partners,
such as `Chef`_, Red Hat, SUSE and Ubuntu, who support the latest POWER hardware
via production and development (Fedora, OpenSUSE, and Debian) distributions.

Members of the community can use these POWER servers to develop and test open
source projects on the `Power Architecture`_ platform and in a `PowerLinux`_
environment. These shared systems are intended for functional development and
testing work, but are not ideal for performance testing.

We offer either POWER7+ big endian instances using LPARs or POWER8 big or little
endian instances running on KVM and providing access via OpenStack's API and GUI
interface. The POWER8 instances offer much more flexibility, giving the ability
to spin up or down instances on demand. We start projects out with a small
quota, but can increase given resource availability and justification.

To request access to a POWER server, use our `request form`_ and we will get
back to you shortly.
