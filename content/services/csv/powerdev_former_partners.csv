"Oregon State University","The goal of this project is to apply mutation testing technique on RCU module of Linux Kernel. They run RCUtorture on Linux kernel for extended period of time and also step-wise increase the testing time on POWER platform."
"University of Alberta and Universidade de Campinas","The goal is to investigate the use of the speculation support in POWER8 for the speeding up the sequential execution of programs. Single-threaded speculation has been used in the past, through trace-based compilation. The goal of this project is to investigate multi-threaded speculation of alternative paths of execution in a sequential execution. This is a joint project between University of Alberta -(UofA) and Universidade de Campinas (Unicamp)."
