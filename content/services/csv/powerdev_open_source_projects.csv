"LLVM Memory Order Loads Handling", "The C standard currently specifies that that memory_order_consume loads feed into carries a dependency, however, no known implementation does anything other than promote memory_order_consume to memory_order_acquire. C users therefore avoid memory_order_consume loads in favour of volatile loads, inline assembly, and other subterfuge. There has been considerable work within the C++ standards committee to address similar issues in C++, however, the current proposals involve C++ templates, which have no reasonable C equivalent. We proposes a new _Dependent_ptr type qualifier to provide this functionality in the C language. We are implementing the same in LLVM."
