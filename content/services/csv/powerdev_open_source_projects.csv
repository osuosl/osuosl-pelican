"LLVM Memory Order Loads Handling", "The C standard currently specifies that that memory_order_consume loads feed into carries a dependency, however, no known implementation does anything other than promote memory_order_consume to memory_order_acquire. C users therefore avoid memory_order_consume loads in favour of volatile loads, inline assembly, and other subterfuge. There has been considerable work within the C++ standards committee to address similar issues in C++, however, the current proposals involve C++ templates, which have no reasonable C equivalent. We proposes a new _Dependent_ptr type qualifier to provide this functionality in the C language. We are implementing the same in LLVM."

Applying the automated tools of the program several quantum chemistry models and techniques of high complexity have been implemented so far including arbitrary single-reference coupled-cluster (CC) and configuration interaction (CI) methods, multi-reference CC approaches, CC and CI energy derivatives and response functions, arbitrary perturbative CC approaches. Many features of the package are also available with relativistic Hamiltonians allowing for accurate calculations on heavy element systems. The developed cost-reduction techniques and local correlation approaches also enable high-precision calculations for medium-sized and large molecules."
