"CADA","CADA - CUDA Accelerated DNA Assembly is being developed by Ryan Kitchen to change the way genome assembly uses hardware resources."
"CASHX Pipeline","Sequence alignment tools CASHX and pipeline were ported to work on the IBM POWER8 to take full advantage of higher thread count machines. CASHX is one of the few non-BWA based high throughput genome alignment tools."
"CASSA","CASSA - CUDA Accelerated Scalable Sequence Aligner. The CGRB is working with Ryan Kitchen to develop this new alignment tool."
"Cryo-EM","Frank Liu and Suvadip Paul are using GPU Acceleration on POWER8 and POWER9 architecture to build, debug, and test software used to examine and model highly detailed microscopic structures such as proteins gathered using Cryo-EM technology."
"Cuttlefish denovo DNA","Eric Aker at PacBell is using the POWER8 platform to test the denovo assembly of the Cuttlefish genome."
"Deeplearning4j","Deeplearning4j is a Java-based toolkit for building/training/deploying deep neural networks. POWER architecture is one of the main platforms that Deeplearning4j project is going to support."
"DIAMOND Sequence Alignment Tool","Benjamin Buchfink - creator of the DIAMOND Sequence alignment tool - helped port this software onto the IBM POWER8 architecture based on requests from the research community. DIAMOND is a sequence aligner for protein and translated DNA searches and it functions as a drop-in replacement for the NCBI Basic Local Alignment Search Tool."
"FBPIC and Numba","Rémi Lehe is working on installing Numba and FBPIC on an OpenPower platform. Once the code is working they plan to run the test suite that we routinely use for Continuous Integration."
"GeneMark","Mark Borodovsky and Alexandre Lomsadze from GeneMark are currently working on porting tools onto the POWER8 platform. GeneMark and its associated tools are used throughout the genomics field for gene prediction."
"Gene Prediction Analysis in Salvia hispanica Genome","Assembles and annotates the Salvia hispanica (Chia) genome to help identify candidates for providing neutraceutical and human health benefits."
"GPGPUSim+Ramulator Simulator","Yunfan Li at Oregon State is using POWER to calibrate a cycle accurate GPU simulator with a real GPU chip."
"Julia Language","Collaboration between IBM, OSU, and Julia Language mathematical software community enabled developers to use graphics processing unit (GPU) technology. This made the software ready for the new CAPI and NVLink acceleration technologies. This was an instrumental step in getting independent software vendors to port to POWER."
"Lecture Video Summarization","There are large number of educational videos on YouTube and other platforms. However the lack of any content based access to the videos make them very difficult to be queried. A students has to watch the full video or jump or fast forward to see whether the video is of his/her interest or not. This summarization tool aims to make such videos more useful and interactive along with a content based index."
"Patagonia","Natural Iron Fertilization."
"PyTorch","Freddie Mendoza is working on PyTorch on the POWER8 systems."
"PyTorch","Using GPUs on POWER to demo running sample AI workloads based on TensorFlow & PyTorch for a workshop event."
"The Street-based Environmental Exposure Project","The Street-based Environmental Exposure Project is using POWER8 for compiling builds and performance testing. Their project is working to understand links between built environment exposures and human health."
"Tensorflow","Ted Chang is building and testing the latest source on POWER because is not a supported architecture of Tensorflow."
"Tensorflow on POWER","Community builds of the TensorFlow Open Source project automatically built on POWER."
"Texas A&M","Jian Tao from Texas A&M is interested in testing the performance of the POWER8 systems."
